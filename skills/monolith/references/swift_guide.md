 Swift Style Guide 

 This style guide is based on Apple’s excellent Swift standard library style and
also incorporates feedback from usage across multiple Swift projects within
Google. It is a living document and the basis upon which the formatter is
implemented.

 Source File Basics 

 File Names 

 All Swift source files end with the extension .swift . 

 In general, the name of a source file best describes the primary entity that it
contains. A file that primarily contains a single type has the name of that
type. A file that extends an existing type with protocol conformance is named
with a combination of the type name and the protocol name, joined with a plus
( + ) sign. For more complex situations, exercise your best judgment. 

 For example, 

 A file containing a single type MyType is named MyType.swift . 
 A file containing a type MyType and some top-level helper functions is also
named MyType.swift . (The top-level helpers are not the primary entity.) 
 A file containing a single extension to a type MyType that adds conformance
to a protocol MyProtocol is named MyType+MyProtocol.swift . 
 A file containing multiple extensions to a type MyType that add
conformances, nested types, or other functionality to a type can be named more
generally, as long as it is prefixed with MyType+ ; for example,
 MyType+Additions.swift . 
 A file containing related declarations that are not otherwise scoped under a
common type or namespace (such as a collection of global mathematical
functions) can be named descriptively; for example, Math.swift . 

 File Encoding 

 Source files are encoded in UTF-8. 

 Whitespace Characters 

 Aside from the line terminator, the Unicode horizontal space character
( U+0020 ) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source
file. The implications are: 

 All other whitespace characters in string and character literals are
represented by their corresponding escape sequence. 
 Tab characters are not used for indentation. 

 Special Escape Sequences 

 For any character that has a special escape sequence ( \t , \n , \r , \" ,
 \' , \\ , and \0 ), that sequence is used rather than the equivalent Unicode
(e.g., \u{000a} ) escape sequence. 

 Invisible Characters and Modifiers 

 Invisible characters, such as the zero width space and other control characters
that do not affect the graphical representation of a string, are always written
as Unicode escape sequences. 

 Control characters, combining characters, and variation selectors that do 
affect the graphical representation of a string are not escaped when they are
attached to a character or characters that they modify. If such a Unicode scalar
is present in isolation or is otherwise not modifying another character in the
same string, it is written as a Unicode escape sequence. 

 The strings below are well-formed because the umlauts and variation selectors
associate with neighboring characters in the string. The second example is in
fact composed of five Unicode scalars, but they are unescaped because the
specific combination is rendered as a single character. 

 let size = "Übergröße" 
 let shrug = "🤷🏿‍️" 

 In the example below, the umlaut and variation selector are in strings by
themselves, so they are escaped. 

 let diaeresis = " \u{0308} " 
 let skinToneType6 = " \u{1F3FF} " 

 If the umlaut were included in the string literally, it would combine with
the preceding quotation mark, impairing readability. Likewise, while most
systems may render a standalone skin tone modifier as a block graphic, the
example below is still forbidden because it is a modifier that is not modifying
a character in the same string. 

 let diaeresis = "̈" 
 let skinToneType6 = "🏿" 

 String Literals 

 Unicode escape sequences ( \u{????} ) and literal code points (for example, Ü )
outside the 7-bit ASCII range are never mixed in the same string. 

 More specifically, string literals are either: 

 composed of a combination of Unicode code points written literally and/or
single character escape sequences (such as \t , but not \u{????} ), or 
 composed of 7-bit ASCII with any number of Unicode escape sequences and/or
other escape sequences. 

 The following example is correct because \n is allowed to be present among
other Unicode code points. 

 let size = "Übergröße \n " 

 The following example is allowed because it follows the rules above, but it is
 not preferred because the text is harder to read and understand compared to
the string above. 

 let size = " \u{00DC} bergr \u{00F6}\u{00DF} e \n " 

 The example below is forbidden because it mixes code points outside the 7-bit
ASCII range in both literal form and in escaped form. 

 let size = "Übergr \u{00F6}\u{00DF} e \n " 

 Aside: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear
that some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that
should happen, those programs are broken and must be fixed. 

 Source File Structure 

 File Comments 

 Comments describing the contents of a source file are optional. They are
discouraged for files that contain only a single abstraction (such as a class
declaration)—in those cases, the documentation comment on the abstraction
itself is sufficient and a file comment is only present if it provides
additional useful information. File comments are allowed for files that contain
multiple abstractions in order to document that grouping as a whole. 

 Import Statements 

 A source file imports exactly the top-level modules that it needs; nothing more
and nothing less. If a source file uses definitions from both UIKit and
 Foundation , it imports both explicitly; it does not rely on the fact that some
Apple frameworks transitively import others as an implementation detail. 

 Imports of whole modules are preferred to imports of individual declarations or
submodules. 

 There are a number of reasons to avoid importing individual members: 

 There is no automated tooling to resolve/organize imports. 
 Existing automated tooling (such as Xcode’s migrator) are less likely to
work well on code that imports individual members because they are
considered corner cases. 
 The prevailing style in Swift (based on official examples and community
code) is to import entire modules. 

 Imports of individual declarations are permitted when importing the whole module
would otherwise pollute the global namespace with top-level definitions (such as
C interfaces). Use your best judgment in these situations. 

 Imports of submodules are permitted if the submodule exports functionality that
is not available when importing the top-level module. For example,
 UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass must be imported explicitly to expose the
methods that allow client code to subclass UIGestureRecognizer —those are
not visible by importing UIKit alone. 

 Import statements are not line-wrapped. 

 Import statements are the first non-comment tokens in a source file. They are
grouped in the following fashion, with the imports in each group ordered
lexicographically and with exactly one blank line between each group: 

 Module/submodule imports not under test 
 Individual declaration imports ( class , enum , func , struct , var ) 
 Modules imported with @testable (only present in test sources) 

 import CoreLocation 
 import MyThirdPartyModule 
 import SpriteKit 
 import UIKit 

 import func Darwin . C . isatty 

 @testable import MyModuleUnderTest 

 Type, Variable, and Function Declarations 

 In general, most source files contain only one top-level type, especially when
the type declaration is large. Exceptions are allowed when it makes sense to
include multiple related types in a single file. For example, 

 A class and its delegate protocol may be defined in the same file. 
 A type and its small related helper types may be defined in the same file.
This can be useful when using fileprivate to restrict certain functionality
of the type and/or its helpers to only that file and not the rest of the
module. 

 The order of types, variables, and functions in a source file, and the order of
the members of those types, can have a great effect on readability. However,
there is no single correct recipe for how to do it; different files and
different types may order their contents in different ways. 

 What is important is that each file and type uses some logical order, 
which its maintainer could explain if asked. For example, new methods are not
just habitually added to the end of the type, as that would yield “chronological
by date added” ordering, which is not a logical ordering. 

 When deciding on the logical order of members, it can be helpful for readers and
future writers (including yourself) to use // MARK: comments to provide
descriptions for that grouping. These comments are also interpreted by Xcode and
provide bookmarks in the source window’s navigation bar. (Likewise,
 // MARK: - , written with a hyphen before the description, causes Xcode to
insert a divider before the menu item.) For example, 

 class MovieRatingViewController : UITableViewController { 

 // MARK: - View controller lifecycle methods 

 override func viewDidLoad () { 
 // ... 
 } 

 override func viewWillAppear ( _ animated : Bool ) { 
 // ... 
 } 

 // MARK: - Movie rating manipulation methods 

 @objc private func ratingStarWasTapped ( _ sender : UIButton ?) { 
 // ... 
 } 

 @objc private func criticReviewWasTapped ( _ sender : UIButton ?) { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 Overloaded Declarations 

 When a type has multiple initializers or subscripts, or a file/type has multiple
functions with the same base name (though perhaps with different argument
labels), and when these overloads appear in the same type or extension scope,
they appear sequentially with no other code in between. 

 Extensions 

 Extensions can be used to organize functionality of a type across multiple
“units.” As with member order, the organizational structure/grouping you choose
can have a great effect on readability; you must use some logical
organizational structure that you could explain to a reviewer if asked. 

 General Formatting 

 Column Limit 

 Swift code has a column limit of 100 characters. Except as noted below, any line
that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped as described in
 Line-Wrapping . 

 Exceptions: 

 Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible without breaking a
meaningful unit of text that should not be broken (for example, a long URL in
a comment). 
 import statements. 
 Code generated by another tool. 

 Braces 

 In general, braces follow Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R) style for non-empty
blocks with exceptions for Swift-specific constructs and rules: 

 There is no line break before the opening brace ( { ), unless required
by application of the rules in Line-Wrapping . 
 There is a line break after the opening brace ( { ), except

 in closures, where the signature of the closure is placed on the same line
as the curly brace, if it fits, and a line break follows the in keyword. 
 where it may be omitted as described in
 One Statement Per Line . 
 empty blocks may be written as {} . 

 There is a line break before the closing brace ( } ), except where it may
be omitted as described in One Statement Per Line ,
or it completes an empty block. 
 There is a line break after the closing brace ( } ), if and only if 
that brace terminates a statement or the body of a declaration. For example,
an else block is written } else { with both braces on the same line. 

 Semicolons 

 Semicolons ( ; ) are not used , either to terminate or separate statements. 

 In other words, the only location where a semicolon may appear is inside a
string literal or a comment. 

 func printSum ( _ a : Int , _ b : Int ) { 
 let sum = a + b 
 print ( sum ) 
 } 

 func printSum ( _ a : Int , _ b : Int ) { 
 let sum = a + b ; 
 print ( sum ); 
 } 

 One Statement Per Line 

 There is at most one statement per line, and each statement is followed by a
line break, except when the line ends with a block that also contains zero
or one statements. 

 guard let value = value else { return 0 } 

 defer { file . close () } 

 switch someEnum { 
 case . first : return 5 
 case . second : return 10 
 case . third : return 20 
 } 

 let squares = numbers . map { $0 * $0 } 

 var someProperty : Int { 
 get { return otherObject . property } 
 set { otherObject . property = newValue } 
 } 

 var someProperty : Int { return otherObject . somethingElse () } 

 required init ?( coder aDecoder : NSCoder ) { fatalError ( "no coder" ) } 

 Wrapping the body of a single-statement block onto its own line is always
allowed. Exercise best judgment when deciding whether to place a conditional
statement and its body on the same line. For example, single line conditionals
work well for early-return and basic cleanup tasks, but less so when the body
contains a function call with significant logic. When in doubt, write it as a
multi-line statement. 

 Line-Wrapping 

 Terminology note: Line-wrapping is the activity of dividing code into
multiple lines that might otherwise legally occupy a single line. 

 For the purposes of Google Swift style, many declarations (such as type
declarations and function declarations) and other expressions (like function
calls) can be partitioned into breakable units that are separated by
 unbreakable delimiting token sequences. 

 As an example, consider the following complex function declaration, which needs
to be line-wrapped: 

 public func index < Elements : Collection , Element > ( of element : Element , in collection : Elements ) -> Elements . Index ? where Elements . Element == Element , Element : Equatable { 
 // ... 
 } 

 This declaration is split as follows (scroll horizontally if necessary to see
the full example). Unbreakable token sequences are indicated in orange;
breakable sequences are indicated in blue. 

 public func index< Elements: Collection, Element >( of element: Element, in collection: Elements ) -> Elements.Index? where Elements.Element == Element, Element: Equatable {
 // ...
}

 The unbreakable token sequence up through the open angle bracket ( < )
that begins the generic argument list. 
 The breakable list of generic arguments. 
 The unbreakable token sequence ( >( ) that separates the generic
arguments from the formal arguments. 
 The breakable comma-delimited list of formal arguments. 
 The unbreakable token-sequence from the closing parenthesis ( ) ) up
through the arrow ( -> ) that precedes the return type. 
 The breakable return type. 
 The unbreakable where keyword that begins the generic constraints list. 
 The breakable comma-delimited list of generic constraints. 

 Using these concepts, the cardinal rules of Google Swift style for line-wrapping
are: 

 If the entire declaration, statement, or expression fits on one line, then do
that. 
 Comma-delimited lists are only laid out in one direction: horizontally or
vertically. In other words, all elements must fit on the same line, or each
element must be on its own line. A horizontally-oriented list does not
contain any line breaks, even before the first element or after the last
element. Except in control flow statements, a vertically-oriented list
contains a line break before the first element and after each element. 
 A continuation line starting with an unbreakable token sequence is indented
at the same level as the original line. 
 A continuation line that is part of a vertically-oriented comma-delimited
list is indented exactly +2 from the original line. 

 When an open curly brace ( { ) follows a line-wrapped declaration or
expression, it is on the same line as the final continuation line unless that
line is indented at +2 from the original line. In that case, the brace is
placed on its own line, to avoid the continuation lines from blending
visually with the body of the subsequent block. 

 public func index < Elements : Collection , Element > ( 
 of element : Element , 
 in collection : Elements 
 ) -> Elements . Index ? 
 where 
 Elements . Element == Element , 
 Element : Equatable 
 { // GOOD. 
 for current in elements { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 public func index < Elements : Collection , Element > ( 
 of element : Element , 
 in collection : Elements 
 ) -> Elements . Index ? 
 where 
 Elements . Element == Element , 
 Element : Equatable { // AVOID. 
 for current in elements { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 For declarations that contain a where clause followed by generic constraints,
additional rules apply: 

 If the generic constraint list exceeds the column limit when placed on the
same line as the return type, then a line break is first inserted before 
the where keyword and the where keyword is indented at the same level as
the original line. 
 If the generic constraint list still exceeds the column limit after inserting
the line break above, then the constraint list is oriented vertically with a
line break after the where keyword and a line break after the final
constraint. 

 Concrete examples of this are shown in the relevant subsections below. 

 This line-wrapping style ensures that the different parts of a declaration are
 quickly and easily identifiable to the reader by using indentation and line
breaks, while also preserving the same indentation level for those parts
throughout the file. Specifically, it prevents the zig-zag effect that would be
present if the arguments are indented based on opening parentheses, as is common
in other languages: 

 public func index < Elements : Collection , Element > ( of element : Element , // AVOID. 
 in collection : Elements ) -> Elements . Index ? 
 where Elements . Element == Element , Element : Equatable { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 Function Declarations 

 modifiers func name ( formal arguments ) {

 modifiers func name ( formal arguments ) -> result {

 modifiers func name < generic arguments >( formal arguments ) throws -> result {

 modifiers func name < generic arguments >( formal arguments ) throws -> result where generic constraints {

 Applying the rules above from left to right gives us the following
line-wrapping: 

 public func index < Elements : Collection , Element > ( 
 of element : Element , 
 in collection : Elements 
 ) -> Elements . Index ? where Elements . Element == Element , Element : Equatable { 
 for current in elements { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 Function declarations in protocols that are terminated with a closing
parenthesis ( ) ) may place the parenthesis on the same line as the final
argument or on its own line. 

 public protocol ContrivedExampleDelegate { 
 func contrivedExample ( 
 _ contrivedExample : ContrivedExample , 
 willDoSomethingTo someValue : SomeValue ) 
 } 

 public protocol ContrivedExampleDelegate { 
 func contrivedExample ( 
 _ contrivedExample : ContrivedExample , 
 willDoSomethingTo someValue : SomeValue 
 ) 
 } 

 If types are complex and/or deeply nested, individual elements in the
arguments/constraints lists and/or the return type may also need to be wrapped.
In these rare cases, the same line-wrapping rules apply to those parts as apply
to the declaration itself. 

 public func performanceTrackingIndex < Elements : Collection , Element > ( 
 of element : Element , 
 in collection : Elements 
 ) -> ( 
 Element . Index ?, 
 PerformanceTrackingIndexStatistics . Timings , 
 PerformanceTrackingIndexStatistics . SpaceUsed 
 ) { 
 // ... 
 } 

 However, typealias es or some other means are often a better way to simplify
complex declarations whenever possible. 

 Type and Extension Declarations 

 The examples below apply equally to class , struct , enum , extension , and
 protocol (with the obvious exception that all but the first do not have
superclasses in their inheritance list, but they are otherwise structurally
similar). 

 modifiers class Name {

 modifiers class Name : superclass and protocols {

 modifiers class Name < generic arguments >: superclass and protocols {

 modifiers class Name < generic arguments >: superclass and protocols where generic constraints {

 class MyClass : 
 MySuperclass , 
 MyProtocol , 
 SomeoneElsesProtocol , 
 SomeFrameworkProtocol 
 { 
 // ... 
 } 

 class MyContainer < Element > : 
 MyContainerSuperclass , 
 MyContainerProtocol , 
 SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol , 
 SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol 
 { 
 // ... 
 } 

 class MyContainer < BaseCollection > : 
 MyContainerSuperclass , 
 MyContainerProtocol , 
 SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol , 
 SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol 
 where BaseCollection : Collection { 
 // ... 
 } 

 class MyContainer < BaseCollection > : 
 MyContainerSuperclass , 
 MyContainerProtocol , 
 SomeoneElsesContainerProtocol , 
 SomeFrameworkContainerProtocol 
 where 
 BaseCollection : Collection , 
 BaseCollection . Element : Equatable , 
 BaseCollection . Element : SomeOtherProtocolOnlyUsedToForceLineWrapping 
 { 
 // ... 
 } 

 Function Calls 

 When a function call is line-wrapped, each argument is written on its own line,
indented +2 from the original line. 

 As with function declarations, if the function call terminates its enclosing
statement and ends with a closing parenthesis ( ) ) (that is, it has no trailing
closure), then the parenthesis may be placed either on the same line as the
final argument or on its own line. 

 let index = index ( 
 of : veryLongElementVariableName , 
 in : aCollectionOfElementsThatAlsoHappensToHaveALongName ) 

 let index = index ( 
 of : veryLongElementVariableName , 
 in : aCollectionOfElementsThatAlsoHappensToHaveALongName 
 ) 

 If the function call ends with a trailing closure and the closure’s signature
must be wrapped, then place it on its own line and wrap the argument list in
parentheses to distinguish it from the body of the closure below it. 

 someAsynchronousAction . execute ( withDelay : howManySeconds , context : actionContext ) { 
 ( context , completion ) in 
 doSomething ( withContext : context ) 
 completion () 
 } 

 Control Flow Statements 

 When a control flow statement (such as if , guard , while , or for ) is
wrapped, the first continuation line is indented to the same position as the
token following the control flow keyword. Additional continuation lines are
indented at that same position if they are syntactically parallel elements, or
in +2 increments from that position if they are syntactically nested. 

 The open brace ( { ) preceding the body of the control flow statement can either
be placed on the same line as the last continuation line or on the next line,
at the same indentation level as the beginning of the statement. For guard 
statements, the else { must be kept together, either on the same line or on
the next line. 

 if aBooleanValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () && 
 aDifferentBooleanValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () && 
 yetAnotherBooleanValueThatContributesToTheWrapping () { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 if aBooleanValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () && 
 aDifferentBooleanValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () && 
 yetAnotherBooleanValueThatContributesToTheWrapping () 
 { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 if let value = aValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing (), 
 let value2 = aDifferentValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 if let value = aValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing (), 
 let value2 = aDifferentValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThingThatForcesTheBraceToBeWrapped () 
 { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 guard let value = aValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing (), 
 let value2 = aDifferentValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () else { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 guard let value = aValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing (), 
 let value2 = aDifferentValueReturnedByAVeryLongOptionalThing () 
 else { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 for element in collection 
 where element . happensToHaveAVeryLongPropertyNameThatYouNeedToCheck { 
 doSomething () 
 } 

 Other Expressions 

 When line-wrapping other expressions that are not function calls (as described
above), the second line (the one immediately following the first break) is
indented exactly +2 from the original line. 

 When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied in
increments of +2 as needed. In general, two continuation lines use the same
indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel
elements. However, if there are many continuation lines caused by long wrapped
expressions, consider splitting them into multiple statements using temporary
variables when possible. 

 let result = anExpression + thatIsMadeUpOf * aLargeNumber + 
 ofTerms / andTherefore % mustBeWrapped + ( 
 andWeWill - keepMakingItLonger * soThatWeHave / aContrivedExample ) 

 let result = anExpression + thatIsMadeUpOf * aLargeNumber + 
 ofTerms / andTherefore % mustBeWrapped + ( 
 andWeWill - keepMakingItLonger * soThatWeHave / aContrivedExample ) 

 Horizontal Whitespace 

 Terminology note: In this section, horizontal whitespace refers to
 interior space. These rules are never interpreted as requiring or forbidding
additional space at the start of a line. 

 Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from
literals and comments, a single Unicode space also appears in the following
places only : 

 Separating any reserved word starting a conditional or switch statement (such
as if , guard , while , or switch ) from the expression that follows it
if that expression starts with an open parenthesis ( ( ). 

 if ( x == 0 && y == 0 ) || z == 0 { 
 // ... 
 } 

 if ( x == 0 && y == 0 ) || z == 0 { 
 // ... 
 } 

 Before any closing curly brace ( } ) that follows code on the same line,
before any open curly brace ( { ), and after any open curly brace ( { ) that
is followed by code on the same line.

 Horizontal Alignment 

 Terminology note: Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a
variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making
certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines. 

 Horizontal alignment is forbidden except when writing obviously tabular data
where omitting the alignment would be harmful to readability. In other cases
(for example, lining up the types of stored property declarations in a struct 
or class ), horizontal alignment is an invitation for maintenance problems if a
new member is introduced that requires every other member to be realigned. 

 struct DataPoint { 
 var value : Int 
 var primaryColor : UIColor 
 } 

 struct DataPoint { 
 var value : Int 
 var primaryColor : UIColor 
 } 

 Vertical Whitespace 

 A single blank line appears in the following locations: 

 Between consecutive members of a type: properties, initializers, methods,
enum cases, and nested types, except that : 

 A blank line is optional between two consecutive stored properties or two
enum cases whose declarations fit entirely on a single line. Such blank
lines can be used to create logical groupings of these declarations. 
 A blank line is optional between two extremely closely related properties
that do not otherwise meet the criterion above; for example, a private
stored property and a related public computed property. 

 Only as needed between statements to organize code into logical
subsections. 
 Optionally before the first member or after the last member of a type
(neither is encouraged nor discouraged). 
 Anywhere explicitly required by other sections of this document. 

 Multiple blank lines are permitted, but never required (nor encouraged). If
you do use multiple consecutive blank lines, do so consistently throughout your
code base. 

 Parentheses 

 Parentheses are not used around the top-most expression that follows an
 if , guard , while , or switch keyword. 

 if x == 0 { 
 print ( "x is zero" ) 
 } 

 if ( x == 0 || y == 1 ) && z == 2 { 
 print ( "..." ) 
 } 

 if ( x == 0 ) { 
 print ( "x is zero" ) 
 } 

 if (( x == 0 || y == 1 ) && z == 2 ) { 
 print ( "..." ) 
 } 

 Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when the author and the reviewer
agree that there is no reasonable chance that the code will be misinterpreted
without them, nor that they would have made the code easier to read. It is not 
reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Swift operator precedence
table memorized. 

 Formatting Specific Constructs 

 Non-Documentation Comments 

 Non-documentation comments always use the double-slash format ( // ), never the
C-style block format ( /* ... */ ). 

 Properties 

 Local variables are declared close to the point at which they are first used
(within reason) to minimize their scope. 

 With the exception of tuple destructuring, every let or var statement
(whether a property or a local variable) declares exactly one variable. 

 var a = 5 
 var b = 10 

 let ( quotient , remainder ) = divide ( 100 , 9 ) 

 var a = 5 , b = 10 

 Switch Statements 

 Case statements are indented at the same level as the switch statement to
which they belong; the statements inside the case blocks are then indented +2
spaces from that level. 

 switch order { 
 case . ascending : 
 print ( "Ascending" ) 
 case . descending : 
 print ( "Descending" ) 
 case . same : 
 print ( "Same" ) 
 } 

 switch order { 
 case . ascending : 
 print ( "Ascending" ) 
 case . descending : 
 print ( "Descending" ) 
 case . same : 
 print ( "Same" ) 
 } 

 switch order { 
 case . ascending : 
 print ( "Ascending" ) 
 case . descending : 
 print ( "Descending" ) 
 case . same : 
 print ( "Same" ) 
 } 

 Enum Cases 

 In general, there is only one case per line in an enum . The comma-delimited
form may be used only when none of the cases have associated values or raw
values, all cases fit on a single line, and the cases do not need further
documentation because their meanings are obvious from their names. 

 public enum Token { 
 case comma 
 case semicolon 
 case identifier 
 } 

 public enum Token { 
 case comma , semicolon , identifier 
 } 

 public enum Token { 
 case comma 
 case semicolon 
 case identifier ( String ) 
 } 

 public enum Token { 
 case comma , semicolon , identifier ( String ) 
 } 

 When all cases of an enum must be indirect , the enum itself is declared
 indirect and the keyword is omitted on the individual cases. 

 public indirect enum DependencyGraphNode { 
 case userDefined ( dependencies : [ DependencyGraphNode ]) 
 case synthesized ( dependencies : [ DependencyGraphNode ]) 
 } 

 public enum DependencyGraphNode { 
 indirect case userDefined ( dependencies : [ DependencyGraphNode ]) 
 indirect case synthesized ( dependencies : [ DependencyGraphNode ]) 
 } 

 When an enum case does not have associated values, empty parentheses are never
present. 

 public enum BinaryTree < Element > { 
 indirect case node ( element : Element , left : BinaryTree , right : BinaryTree ) 
 case empty // GOOD. 
 } 

 public enum BinaryTree < Element > { 
 indirect case node ( element : Element , left : BinaryTree , right : BinaryTree ) 
 case empty () // AVOID. 
 } 

 The cases of an enum must follow a logical ordering that the author could
explain if asked. If there is no obviously logical ordering, use a
lexicographical ordering based on the cases’ names. 

 In the following example, the cases are arranged in numerical order based on the
underlying HTTP status code and blank lines are used to separate groups. 

 public enum HTTPStatus : Int { 
 case ok = 200 

 case badRequest = 400 
 case notAuthorized = 401 
 case paymentRequired = 402 
 case forbidden = 403 
 case notFound = 404 

 case internalServerError = 500 
 } 

 The following version of the same enum is less readable. Although the cases are
ordered lexicographically, the meaningful groupings of related values has been
lost. 

 public enum HTTPStatus : Int { 
 case badRequest = 400 
 case forbidden = 403 
 case internalServerError = 500 
 case notAuthorized = 401 
 case notFound = 404 
 case ok = 200 
 case paymentRequired = 402 
 } 

 Trailing Closures 

 Functions should not be overloaded such that two overloads differ only by the
name of their trailing closure argument. Doing so prevents using trailing
closure syntax—when the label is not present, a call to the function with
a trailing closure is ambiguous. 

 Consider the following example, which prohibits using trailing closure syntax to
call greet : 

 func greet ( enthusiastically nameProvider : () -> String ) { 
 print ( "Hello, \( nameProvider () ) ! It's a pleasure to see you!" ) 
 } 

 func greet ( apathetically nameProvider : () -> String ) { 
 print ( "Oh, look. It's \( nameProvider () ) ." ) 
 } 

 greet { "John" } // error: ambiguous use of 'greet' 

 This example is fixed by differentiating some part of the function name other
than the closure argument—in this case, the base name: 

 func greetEnthusiastically ( _ nameProvider : () -> String ) { 
 print ( "Hello, \( nameProvider () ) ! It's a pleasure to see you!" ) 
 } 

 func greetApathetically ( _ nameProvider : () -> String ) { 
 print ( "Oh, look. It's \( nameProvider () ) ." ) 
 } 

 greetEnthusiastically { "John" } 
 greetApathetically { "not John" } 

 If a function call has multiple closure arguments, then none are called using
trailing closure syntax; all are labeled and nested inside the argument
list’s parentheses. 

 UIView . animate ( 
 withDuration : 0.5 , 
 animations : { 
 // ... 
 }, 
 completion : { finished in 
 // ... 
 }) 

 UIView . animate ( 
 withDuration : 0.5 , 
 animations : { 
 // ... 
 }) { finished in 
 // ... 
 } 

 If a function has a single closure argument and it is the final argument, then
it is always called using trailing closure syntax, except in the following
cases to resolve ambiguity or parsing errors: 

 As described above, labeled closure arguments must be used to disambiguate
between two overloads with otherwise identical arguments lists. 
 Labeled closure arguments must be used in control flow statements where the
body of the trailing closure would be parsed as the body of the control flow
statement. 

 Timer . scheduledTimer ( timeInterval : 30 , repeats : false ) { timer in 
 print ( "Timer done!" ) 
 } 

 if let firstActive = list . first ( where : { $0 . isActive }) { 
 process ( firstActive ) 
 } 

 Timer . scheduledTimer ( timeInterval : 30 , repeats : false , block : { timer in 
 print ( "Timer done!" ) 
 }) 

 // This example fails to compile. 
 if let firstActive = list . first { $0 . isActive } { 
 process ( firstActive ) 
 } 

 When a function called with trailing closure syntax takes no other arguments,
empty parentheses ( () ) after the function name are never present. 

 let squares = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . map { $0 * $0 } 

 let squares = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . map ({ $0 * $0 }) 
 let squares = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . map () { $0 * $0 } 

 Trailing Commas 

 Trailing commas in array and dictionary literals are required when each
element is placed on its own line. Doing so produces cleaner diffs when items
are added to those literals later. 

 let configurationKeys = [ 
 "bufferSize" , 
 "compression" , 
 "encoding" , // GOOD. 
 ] 

 let configurationKeys = [ 
 "bufferSize" , 
 "compression" , 
 "encoding" // AVOID. 
 ] 

 Numeric Literals 

 It is recommended but not required that long numeric literals (decimal,
hexadecimal, octal, and binary) use the underscore ( _ ) separator to group
digits for readability when the literal has numeric value or when there exists a
domain-specific grouping. 

 Recommended groupings are three digits for decimal (thousands separators), four
digits for hexadecimal, four or eight digits for binary literals, or
value-specific field boundaries when they exist (such as three digits for octal
file permissions). 

 Do not group digits if the literal is an opaque identifier that does not have a
meaningful numeric value. 

 Attributes 

 Parameterized attributes (such as @availability(...) or @objc(...) ) are each
written on their own line immediately before the declaration to which they
apply, are lexicographically ordered, and are indented at the same level as the
declaration. 

 @available(iOS 9.0, *) 
 public func coolNewFeature () { 
 // ... 
 } 

 @available(iOS 9.0, *) public func coolNewFeature () { 
 // ... 
 } 

 Attributes without parameters (for example, @objc without arguments,
 @IBOutlet , or @NSManaged ) are lexicographically ordered and may be placed
on the same line as the declaration if and only if they would fit on that line
without requiring the line to be rewrapped. If placing an attribute on the same
line as the declaration would require a declaration to be wrapped that
previously did not need to be wrapped, then the attribute is placed on its own
line. 

 public class MyViewController : UIViewController { 
 @IBOutlet private var tableView : UITableView ! 
 } 

 Naming 

 Apple’s API Style Guidelines 

 Apple’s
 official Swift naming and API design guidelines 
hosted on swift.org are considered part of this style guide and are followed as
if they were repeated here in their entirety. 

 Naming Conventions Are Not Access Control 

 Restricted access control ( internal , fileprivate , or private ) is preferred
for the purposes of hiding information from clients, rather than naming
conventions. 

 Naming conventions (such as prefixing a leading underscore) are only used in
rare situations when a declaration must be given higher visibility than is
otherwise desired in order to work around language limitations—for
example, a type that has a method that is only intended to be called by other
parts of a library implementation that crosses module boundaries and must
therefore be declared public . 

 Identifiers 

 In general, identifiers contain only 7-bit ASCII characters. Unicode identifiers
are allowed if they have a clear and legitimate meaning in the problem domain
of the code base (for example, Greek letters that represent mathematical
concepts) and are well understood by the team who owns the code. 

 let smile = "😊" 
 let deltaX = newX - previousX 
 let Δx = newX - previousX 

 let 😊 = "😊" 

 Initializers 

 For clarity, initializer arguments that correspond directly to a stored property
have the same name as the property. Explicit self. is used during assignment
to disambiguate them. 

 public struct Person { 
 public let name : String 
 public let phoneNumber : String 

 // GOOD. 
 public init ( name : String , phoneNumber : String ) { 
 self . name = name 
 self . phoneNumber = phoneNumber 
 } 
 } 

 public struct Person { 
 public let name : String 
 public let phoneNumber : String 

 // AVOID. 
 public init ( name otherName : String , phoneNumber otherPhoneNumber : String ) { 
 name = otherName 
 phoneNumber = otherPhoneNumber 
 } 
 } 

 Static and Class Properties 

 Static and class properties that return instances of the declaring type are
 not suffixed with the name of the type. 

 public class UIColor { 
 public class var red : UIColor { // GOOD. 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 public class URLSession { 
 public class var shared : URLSession { // GOOD. 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 public class UIColor { 
 public class var redColor : UIColor { // AVOID. 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 public class URLSession { 
 public class var sharedSession : URLSession { // AVOID. 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 When a static or class property evaluates to a singleton instance of the
declaring type, the names shared and default are commonly used. This style
guide does not require specific names for these; the author should choose a name
that makes sense for the type. 

 Global Constants 

 Like other variables, global constants are lowerCamelCase . Hungarian notation,
such as a leading g or k , is not used. 

 let secondsPerMinute = 60 

 let SecondsPerMinute = 60 
 let kSecondsPerMinute = 60 
 let gSecondsPerMinute = 60 
 let SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60 

 Delegate Methods 

 Methods on delegate protocols and delegate-like protocols (such as data sources)
are named using the linguistic syntax described below, which is inspired by
Cocoa’s protocols. 

 The term “delegate’s source object” refers to the object that invokes methods
on the delegate. For example, a UITableView is the source object that
invokes methods on the UITableViewDelegate that is set as the view’s
 delegate property. 

 All methods take the delegate’s source object as the first argument. 

 For methods that take the delegate’s source object as their only argument: 

 If the method returns Void (such as those used to notify the delegate that
an event has occurred), then the method’s base name is the delegate’s
source type followed by an indicative verb phrase describing the
event. The argument is unlabeled. 

 func scrollViewDidBeginScrolling ( _ scrollView : UIScrollView ) 

 If the method returns Bool (such as those that make an assertion about the
delegate’s source object itself), then the method’s name is the delegate’s
source type followed by an indicative or conditional verb phrase 
describing the assertion. The argument is unlabeled. 

 func scrollViewShouldScrollToTop ( _ scrollView : UIScrollView ) -> Bool 

 If the method returns some other value (such as those querying for
information about a property of the delegate’s source object), then the
method’s base name is a noun phrase describing the property being
queried. The argument is labeled with a preposition or phrase with a
trailing preposition that appropriately combines the noun phrase and the
delegate’s source object. 

 func numberOfSections ( in scrollView : UIScrollView ) -> Int 

 For methods that take additional arguments after the delegate’s source
object, the method’s base name is the delegate’s source type by itself and
the first argument is unlabeled. Then: 

 If the method returns Void , the second argument is labeled with an
indicative verb phrase describing the event that has the argument as its
 direct object or prepositional object, and any other arguments (if
present) provide further context. 

 func tableView ( 
 _ tableView : UITableView , 
 willDisplayCell cell : UITableViewCell , 
 forRowAt indexPath : IndexPath ) 

 If the method returns Bool , the second argument is labeled with an
indicative or conditional verb phrase that describes the return value in
terms of the argument, and any other arguments (if present) provide further
context. 

 func tableView ( 
 _ tableView : UITableView , 
 shouldSpringLoadRowAt indexPath : IndexPath , 
 with context : UISpringLoadedInteractionContext 
 ) -> Bool 

 If the method returns some other value, the second argument is labeled
with a noun phrase and trailing preposition that describes the return
value in terms of the argument, and any other arguments (if present) provide
further context. 

 func tableView ( 
 _ tableView : UITableView , 
 heightForRowAt indexPath : IndexPath 
 ) -> CGFloat 

 Apple’s documentation on
 delegates and data sources 
also contains some good general guidance about such names. 

 Programming Practices 

 Common themes among the rules in this section are: avoid redundancy, avoid
ambiguity, and prefer implicitness over explicitness unless being explicit
improves readability and/or reduces ambiguity. 

 Compiler Warnings 

 Code should compile without warnings when feasible. Any warnings that are able
to be removed easily by the author must be removed. 

 A reasonable exception is deprecation warnings, where it may not be possible to
immediately migrate to the replacement API, or where an API may be deprecated
for external users but must still be supported inside a library during a
deprecation period. 

 Initializers 

 For struct s, Swift synthesizes a non-public memberwise init that takes
arguments for var properties and for any let properties that lack default
values. When that initializer is suitable (that is, a public one is not
needed), it is used and no explicit initializer is written. 

 The initializers declared by the special ExpressibleBy*Literal compiler
protocols are never called directly. 

 struct Kilometers : ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral { 
 init ( integerLiteral value : Int ) { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 let k1 : Kilometers = 10 // GOOD. 
 let k2 = 10 as Kilometers // ALSO GOOD. 

 struct Kilometers : ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral { 
 init ( integerLiteral value : Int ) { 
 // ... 
 } 
 } 

 let k = Kilometers ( integerLiteral : 10 ) // AVOID. 

 Explicitly calling .init(...) is allowed only when the receiver of the call is
a metatype variable. In direct calls to the initializer using the literal type
name, .init is omitted. ( Referring to the initializer directly by using
 MyType.init syntax to convert it to a closure is permitted.) 

 let x = MyType ( arguments ) 

 let type = lookupType ( context ) 
 let x = type . init ( arguments ) 

 let x = makeValue ( factory : MyType . init ) 

 let x = MyType . init ( arguments ) 

 Properties 

 The get block for a read-only computed property is omitted and its body is
directly nested inside the property declaration. 

 var totalCos
```
